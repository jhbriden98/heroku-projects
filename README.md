# ancient-springs - (ToyApp) - https://ancient-springs-49008.herokuapp.com/users

This app is a demo of basic scaffolding and relationships in Rails. The application is the barest of bare-bones blogs. The user can navigate back and forth between two pages titled Users and Microposts, create new users, and create new microposts that are then tied to a designated user.

# thawing-ravine - (Library) - https://thawing-ravine-35136.herokuapp.com/

This app is a reiteration of basic scaffolding and relationships in Rails. The application is designed to front information for a small library. The user can navigate back and forth between two pages titled 'Books' and 'Authors', and create, edit, destroy, and view books and authors.
